            @Step {
                Create a folder `Public` outside of the `Sources` folder.
                
                > Note: _The public folder contains any public files that will be served by your application._
            }
            @Step {
                Make a right click on the project in the project navigator and select `ComponentsPlugin`. It will build the plugin and start the deployment.
                
                > Note: _HTMLKit creates a vendor folder at the public directory._
            }
            @Step {
                Select `Product` > `Scheme` > `Edit Scheme` to set the working directory for your project.
            }
            @Step {
                Check the working directory on the `Options` tab and enter the path to the root folder of your project.

            @Step {
                Import the module `HTMLKitComponents` at the top of `ExampleView`.
                
                @Code(name: "ExampleView.swift", file: "view-S5.swift", previousFile: "view-S4.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Give the view a valid HTML structure.
                
                @Code(name: "ExampleView.swift", file: "view-S6.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Place the file reference to the stylesheet.
                
                > Note: _The file is responsible for the styling and utilities._
                
                @Code(name: "ExampleView.swift", file: "view-S7.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Place the file reference for the javascript query.
                
                > Note: _The file is responsible for..._
                
                @Code(name: "ExampleView.swift", file: "view-S8.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Place the file reference to the javascript files for the components.
                
                > Note: _The file is responsible for..._
                
                @Code(name: "ExampleView.swift", file: "view-S9.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Surround the `Heading1` element with a `Card` component.
                
                @Code(name: "ExampleView.swift", file: "view-S10.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Change the border of the card by using the `borderShape` modifier.
                
                @Code(name: "ExampleView.swift", file: "view-S11.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Select `Editor` > `Run` to rerun the application. Refresh your browser.
            }
        }
    }
